        Our project is a auto input tracking sheet for Computer Science majors in the class of 2025. A user can take an
    excel file (downloaded from My Academic Progess in WorkDay) and uploaded (sometimes will need to unmerge first row, or take it out of
    protect mode). The the user can upload the excel file to our website and it will autofill a tracking sheet. A user is required to login or register
    allowing them to view their tracking sheet after leaving the site if they save it. This allows the user to not only having a constantly updated tracking sheet
    wherever they are but also allows them to periodically update it with a new excel file or manually add classes to make sure they will graduate with 
    the required courses.
        We think this is useful to the general body because it is annoying to constantly have a paper tracking sheet filled out, or to have a pdf that your constantly
    writing in yourself with your classes. Instead simply being able to import your Academic Progress takes the time and stress off the user. Going forward we would like to add 
    more possible tracking sheets (years and class). In addition there is also an About Page, Instructions Page, Home Page, Login Page, and a Register Page.
